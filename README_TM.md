# Traffic Matrix Prediction
This repos is forked from the `thuml/Time-Series-Library`, aiming to use Transformer-based time series models to predict network traffic matrix (TM).

## Dataset
Obtain the original traffic matrix datasets from [] or [], then place the downloaded data in the folder `./dataset` 

The `*-OD_pair.csv` files are obtained from `THU-INSC-NAD/Traffic-Matrix-Prediction` whose latest commit SHA is `3f30e5825692d6683ed38b6089809b66e95110b1`.

## Scripts
Scripts on `Abilene` and `CERNET` datasets are available in the folder `./scripts/long_term_forecast/Abilene/` and `./scripts/long_term_forecast/CERNET/`, respectively.
